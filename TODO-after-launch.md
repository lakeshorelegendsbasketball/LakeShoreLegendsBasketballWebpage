# LakeShore Legends — after-launch checklist

## 1. Add openings (planned for Oct 6)
Until then the booking page shows no dates; families can still use **Request Training**.

- [x] Open https://www.lakeshorelegendsbasketball.com/coach-admin.html and check there's **no orange "Test server" badge** next to your name.
- [ ] Go to **Availability** and add openings. **Recurring** fills several weeks at once; **Bulk add** fills one day with back-to-back sessions.
- [ ] Open the booking page (training.html) and confirm the dates show up.

## 2. Family emails — LIVE (9/29)
Resend verified; DNS now on Cloudflare; emails send from bookings@lakeshorelegendsbasketball.com to families.
- [x] Reply-to and coach alert emails set in Settings → Notifications (test email landed in the inbox).

## 3. First real booking
- [ ] After a family pays, the booking turns **Confirmed + Paid** on its own and they land back on your training page. If it stays "Awaiting payment", ask Claude to check the server log.
- [ ] For a group session, the booking shows "1 of N athletes paid" until every family has paid with the shared link (tick **Paid** by hand for cash or Venmo).

## 4. Search & AI visibility
- [ ] Google Business Profile: waiting on Google's verification. Once verified, add photos, and ask a few families for reviews. Send Claude the profile's Maps link so it can be added to the site's structured data.
- [ ] (Optional) Bing Webmaster Tools: import from Google Search Console and submit the sitemap — helps ChatGPT search.

## Done
